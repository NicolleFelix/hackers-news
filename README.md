## Building a newsreader using the HackerNews Api, React, React Testing Library, Styled Components, Axios & Memo. (http://bit.ly/CognitiveSurge)

This application is a newsreader that calls the Hackernews Api. This project was built using React (create-react-app as a base) and the technologies used were React (Custom Hooks), Styled Components, Axios, Memo and React Testing Library. I'm hoping this application gives people a better understanding of React. This application was built for a YouTube video which can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DLRJj1YjvQ

Subscribe to my YouTube channel here: http://bit.ly/CognitiveSurge where I build projects like this! And don't forget, you can contribute to this project (highly encouraged!). One thing I didn't get time to do was incorporate accessibility into this application, so I'd love to see that added!
